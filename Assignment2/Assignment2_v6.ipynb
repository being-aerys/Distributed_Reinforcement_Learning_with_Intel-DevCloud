    "# Distributed Synchronous Value Iteration\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to implement both single-core and distributed versions of syncronous value iteration (VI). In particuar, VI will be applied to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in order to compute policies that optimize expected infinite horizon discounted cummulative reward. \n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant content about MDPs and VI are in the following course notes from CS533. \n",

    "### Synchronous Value Iteration Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a review of the synchronous value iteration algorithm. The algorithm is iterative and each iteration produces a newly updated value function $V_{new}$ based on the value function from the previous iteration $V_{curr}$. This is done by applying the Bellman backup operator to $V_{curr}$ at each state. That is, \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "V_{new}(s) = \\max_{a\\in A} R(s,a) + \\beta \\sum_{s'\\in S} T(s,a,s') V_{curr}(s')\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\beta \\in [0,1)$ is the discount factor, $R$ is the reward function, and $T$ is the transition function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm also maintains the greedy policy $\\pi$ at each iteration, which is based on a one-step look ahead operator: \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\pi_{curr}(s) = \\arg\\max_{a\\in A} R(s,a) + \\beta \\sum_{s'\\in S} T(s,a,s') V_{curr}(s')\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "After an update we define the Bellman error of that iteration as $\\max_s |V_{new}(s)-V_{curr}(s)|$. In the notes, it is shown that this error allows us to bound the difference between the value function of $\\pi_{curr}$ and the optimal value function $V^{*}$. Thus, a typical stopping condition for VI is to iterate until the Bellman error is below a specified threshold $\\epsilon$. Putting everything together, the overall algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with $V_{curr}(s) = 0$ for all $s$\n",
    "- error = $\\infty$\n",
    "- While error > $\\epsilon$ \n",
    "    - For each state $s$ \n",
    "        - $V_{new}(s) = \\max_{a\\in A} R(s,a) + \\beta \\sum_{s'\\in S} T(s,a,s') V_{curr}(s')$\n",
    "        - $\\pi_{curr}(s) = \\arg\\max_{a\\in A} R(s,a) + \\beta \\sum_{s'\\in S} T(s,a,s') V_{curr}(s')$\n",
    "    - error = $\\max_s |V_{new}(s)-V_{curr}(s)|$   ;; could do this incrementally      \n",
    "    - $V_{curr} = V_{new}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we refer to this version of VI as synchronous is because it maintains both a current and new value function, where all values of the new value function are computed based on the fixed current value function. That is, each iteration updates all states based on the value function of the previous iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify this first assignment, we have decided to focus on Synchronous VI and to investigate how to best create a distributed implementation using the Ray framework. In particular, a distributed version of Synchronous VI should still produce a sequence of value functions and policies that are equivalent to those that would be produced by a single-core version, but ideally do so much faster. The remainder of this notebook guides you through some of the MDP mechanics and algorithm implementations. The grand finale of this first assignment is a competition where you will try to develop the fasted distributed implementation that you can. "

    "## Synchronous Value Iteration Using GetSuccessors()\n",
    "The above version of value iteration can be very innefficient when the number of states is large because it iterates over all next states. In practice, it is usually the case that for any state $s$ and action $a$ most states have zero probability of being successors. We can exploit that fact to make value iteration more efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this part is to use GetSuccessors() function to decrease the running time. This function takes a state and an action as input and returns the possible next states (with non-zero transition probability) and their transition probabilities. this allows us to ignore all states with zero transition probability. Implement value iteration in the following cell following the previous implmentation. But, here, use the env.GetSuccessors() function ot limit the Bellman backup to only consider non-zero probability states in the summation over next states. Using this function you will not need the GetTransitionProb function.\n"

    "## Distributed Synchronous Value Iteration -- Version 1\n",
    "A simple way to distribute Value Iteration would be to implement each iteration by having a each state updated by a distinct worker. That is each state is updated by creating a work to do the Bellman backup for that state and then recording the result. In order to avoid creating an enormous number of workers, the first implementation will only allow a specified number of workers to be active at any time. After each iteration, the main process checks the Bellman error and if it is less than the specified epsilon it terminates. The following diagram demonstrates the architecture of such a system.\n",

    "One way to improve the above approach is to create a limited number of workers and have each worker perform backups on a batch of states. Effectively, this approach partitions the state space and uses a worker to handle each state subset of the partition. The following diagram demonstrates the architecture of such a system.\n",

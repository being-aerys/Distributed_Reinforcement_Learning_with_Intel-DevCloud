    "# Distributed Q-Learning and SARSA\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to implement both single-core and distributed versions of two temporal difference (TD) reinforcement learning algorithms, Q-Learning and SARSA. In particuar, Q-Learning and SARSA will be run in a Markov Decision Process environment in order to compute policies that optimize expected infinite horizon discounted cummulative reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant content about Q-Learning and SARSA are in the following course notes from CS533.\n",

    "## Recap of Q-Learning and SARSA \n",
    "\n",
    "Q-Learning and SARSA appear to be extremely similar algorithms at the code level. In particular, their update formulas are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mbox{SARSA:  } Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a) + \\alpha\\cdot \\left(r + \\beta Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)\\right) \\\\\n",
    "\\mbox{Q-Learning:  } Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a) + \\alpha\\cdot \\left(r + \\beta \\max_a' Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)\\right) \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $s'$ and $r$ are the next state and reward after taking action $a$ in state $s$. Further, for SARSA, $a'$ is the action that was taken by the agent in $s'$. \n",
    "\n",
    "While these updates a are similar, the algorithms are different in a fundamental way. SARSA is an on-policy algorithm, which aims to learn the value of the policy that is being used to collect data (we call this the behavior policy). In the case of policy optimization, this behavior policy is an exploration-exploitation policy. This is why $a'$ in the SARSA algorithm is based on the action actually taken by the behavior policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather, Q-Learning is an off-policy algorithm, which can learn from any set of experience tuples, regardless of how they were collected. In particular, notice that Q-Learning is not sensitive to what action (if any) was taken in $s'$, while SARSA must be given the action that was actually taken in $s'$. Even if the exploration policy were completely random, Q-Learning will converge in the limit to an optimal policy under standard assumptions on the learning rate decay. \n",
    "\n",
    "The off-policy versus on-policy difference can lead the algorithms to sometimes learn different policies in practice. The assignment below will give you the opportunity to implement both SARSA and Q-Learning and to observe and explain such differences. After first implementing a single-core version of the algorithms, you will then implement a distributed version of Q-Learning. Note that the off-policy nature of Q-Learning makes it more directly compatible with distributed implementations compared to SARSA, since the experience need not come from a particular behavior policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the exercise, you need to finish all parts of this notebook. You also need to turn in a report---the notebook exercises will indicate what should be included in the report.  "

    "We will use the FrozenLake environment as the MDP environment for this experiment. This is a type of gridworld environment, whose size (number of states) can be controlled by adjusting the grid dimensions. The environment is intended to model the process of navigating a frozen lake, while avoiding falling into holes with the objective of reaching a goal location. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- There are four possible actions (Left, Right, Down, Up). \n",

    "- The transition function moves the agent in the expected direction with 0.97 probability, and there is a 0.03 probability of transitioning to one of the other randomly selected directions. \n",
